## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The use of variables was implemented in this challenge. Careful attention was put on gathering all the properties that needed variables in the style guide before ever putting style to elements. The ease of adding variables as values of properties in this way was substantial that I finished in a considerably fast time. Even having typed notes to look through as chacklist for what needs to be done made the styling process smoother.

Another useful skill practices was the use of font presets and the property value inherit. This made for less code repetition and clearer view of the CSS.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
/* Something like this for varaibles */

/* Setting variables */

:root {
  --color1: rgb(20, 20, 20); /* Grey-900 */
  --color2: rgb(31, 31, 31); /* Grey-800 */
```

### Continued development

The use of these new found skills will be used for future challenges and projects. Font properties have yet to be researched so that will be the next plan. More challenges will be done so it is yet to be determined what other new skills will be learned.
